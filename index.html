    <h1> This is the Wind Engineering with Uncertainty Quantification (WE-UQ) Application</h1>

    <p>
      The WE-UQ Application (WE-UQ App) is an open-source software
      (https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/WE-UQ) that provides researchers a tool to
      assess the performance of a building to wind loading. The application
      focuses on quantifying building performance through decision variables. Given
      that the properties of the buildings and the wind events are not known
      exactly, and that the simulation software and the user make simplifying
      assumptions in the numerical modeling of the structure, the estimate response of
      the structure already exhibits significant variability. Such response can be
      estimated using our WE-UQ Application
      
      (<a href="https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/research-tools/we-uq//">https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/research-tools/we-uq/</a>).
