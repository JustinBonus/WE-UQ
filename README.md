# Why Use WE-UQ?

The ``WE-UQ`` desktop application is a user-facing portal for cutting-edge engineering workflows targeting extreme wind demands on structures. It is a free, open-source, graphical software for simulating a structures's response with uncertainty quantification (UQ) during extreme wind natural hazard loading. The application's interchangeable workflow allows you to swap between popular uncertainty quantification methods (e.g. Sensitivity, Reliability, Surrogates) to upgrade your previously deterministic models. Modular design lets you drop-in your own building models (SIM), event types (EVT), nonlinear structural analysis (FEM), engineering demand parameters (EDP), and more.


## Capabilities

- Drop-in uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods like forward propagation, sensitivity, and reliability analysis onto previously deterministic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models using ``SimCenter UQ`` and/or ``Dakota`` backends
- Model experiments from validated wind flume digital twins
- Synoptic and non-synoptic wind events supported
- Generate stochastic wind loads by taking surrounding exposure conditions, turbulence characteristics, and wind speed as inputs
- Obtain wind force-time histories from existing aerodynamics databases
- Generate integrated loads and point pressures on buildings from CFD simulations using ``OpenFOAM``
- User-defined buildings for wind loading input and structural response output
- Design structures including Multi-degree-of-freedom (``MDOF``) model, steel building model, ``OpenSees`` models, and ``OpenSeesPy`` models
- Output probabilistic building responses, velocities and pressure at any point in the fluid domain

## SimCenter Eco-System

The challenges of natural hazards engineering are addressed by the NHERI SimCenter through a suite of applications that provide cutting-edge tools for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders. The applications are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive solution for natural hazards engineering. A puzzle-piece diagram of the SimCenter ecosystem is shown below:



<a href="https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/"><img width="75%" src="./icons/SimCenter_PuzzlePieces_Horizontal.png" align="center" /></a>



In reality, this is a software workflow representation of the PEER Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework that has been extended to include other natural hazards:



<a href="https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/"><img width="85%" src="./icons/SimCenter_PEER_PBE.png" align="center" /></a>



``WE-UQ`` is just one part of the [NHERI SimCenter](https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org) ecosystem that provides cutting-edge open-source tools for natural hazards engineering. Tools like ``quoFEM``, ``EE-UQ``, ``WE-UQ``, ``HydroUQ``, ``PBE``, and ``R2D`` work together to provide a comprehensive solution for natural hazards engineering. The SimCenter ecosytem forms a modular hierarchy that allows users to pick and choose the tools they need for their specific research or engineering problem.



<img width=60% align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NHERI-SimCenter/WE-UQ/master/icons/SimCenter_Hierarchy.png" />

While ``R2D`` is the top-level application that provides a regional resilience assessment, ``EE-UQ``, ``WE-UQ``, and ``HydroUQ`` provide uncertainty quantified simulations for earthquake, wind, and water-borne natural hazards, respectively. ``quoFEM`` is the backend UQ functionality they use.

Additional tools, such as ``BRAILS`` and ``TInF``, have special use-cases including AI-augmentation of building stock and creation of turbulent wind inflow for OpenFOAM CFD simulations.


All applications are free, open-source, and available for download on the [DesignSafe-CI](https://www.designsafe-ci.org) website. See the table below for more information on each application:
