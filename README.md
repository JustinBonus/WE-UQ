# Why Use WE-UQ?

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3274227.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3274227)

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/58ka2pwtvddek7bt?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fmckenna/we-uq)

This open-source research application provides an application that can be used to predict the response of a building subjected to wind events. The application is focused on quantifying the uncertainties in the predicted response, given the that the properties of the buildings and the wind events are not known exactly, and that both the simulation software and the user make simplifying assumptions in the numerical modeling of that structure. In this application, the user is required to characterize the uncertainties in the input. The application will, after utilizing the users selected sampling method, provide information that characterizes the uncertainties in the computed response measures. As the computations to make these determinations can be prohibitively expensive to perform on a user's local computer, the user has the option to perform the computations remotely on HPC resources located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) and made available to the user through NHERI DesignSafe, the cyberinfrastructure provider for the distributed NSF funded Natural Hazards in Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) facility.

This tool is under active development. Researchers are encouraged to comment on what additional
features and applications they would like to see in this
application. If you want it, chances are many of your colleagues also
would benefit from it. Additional requests should be posted at the [SimCenter forum](https://simcenter-messageboard.designsafe-ci.org/smf/index.php?board=5.0).


Please visit the [WE-UQ Research Tool webpage](https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/research-tools/we-uq/)
for more resources related to this tool. Additionally, this page
provides more information on the NHERI SimCenter, including other SimCenter
applications, FAQ, and how to collaborate.

## SimCenter Eco-System

The challenges of natural hazards engineering are addressed by the NHERI SimCenter through a suite of applications that provide cutting-edge tools for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders. The applications are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive solution for natural hazards engineering. A puzzle-piece diagram of the SimCenter ecosystem is shown below:



<a href="https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/"><img width="75%" src="./icons/SimCenter_PuzzlePieces_Horizontal.png" align="center" /></a>



In reality, this is a software workflow representation of the PEER Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework that has been extended to include other natural hazards:



<a href="https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/"><img width="85%" src="./icons/SimCenter_PEER_PBE.png" align="center" /></a>



``WE-UQ`` is just one part of the [NHERI SimCenter](https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org) ecosystem that provides cutting-edge open-source tools for natural hazards engineering. Tools like ``quoFEM``, ``EE-UQ``, ``WE-UQ``, ``HydroUQ``, ``PBE``, and ``R2D`` work together to provide a comprehensive solution for natural hazards engineering. The SimCenter ecosytem forms a modular hierarchy that allows users to pick and choose the tools they need for their specific research or engineering problem.



<img width=60% align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustinBonus/WE-UQ/master/icons/SimCenter_Hierarchy.png" />

While ``R2D`` is the top-level application that provides a regional resilience assessment, ``EE-UQ``, ``WE-UQ``, and ``HydroUQ`` provide uncertainty quantified simulations for earthquake, wind, and water-borne natural hazards, respectively. ``quoFEM`` is the backend UQ functionality they use.

Additional tools, such as ``BRAILS`` and ``TInF``, have special use-cases including AI-augmentation of building stock and creation of turbulent wind inflow for OpenFOAM CFD simulations.


All applications are free, open-source, and available for download on the [DesignSafe-CI](https://www.designsafe-ci.org) website. See the table below for more information on each application:
