This is the Wind Engineering with Uncertainty Quantification (WE-UQ) Application.
</h1>
<p>
The WE-UQ Application (WE-UQ App) is an open-source software
(https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/WE-UQ) that provides researchers a tool to
assess the performance of a building to wind loading. The application
focuses on quantifying building performance through decision variables. Given
that the properties of the buildings and the wind events are not known
exactly, and that the simulation software and the user make simplifying
assumptions in the numerical modeling of the structure, the estimate response of
 the structure already exhibits significant variability. Such response can be
 estimated using our WE-UQ Application
 (<a href="https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/research-tools/we-uq//">https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/research-tools/we-uq/</a>).
<p>
Depending on the type of structural system, the fidelity of the numerical model
and the number of EDP samples required, the response history simulations can be
computationally prohibitively expensive. To overcome this impediment, the user
has the option to perform the response simulations on the Stampede2
supercomputer. Stampede2 is located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center and
made available to the user through NHERI DesignSafe-CI, the cyberinfrastructure
provider for the distributed NSF funded Natural Hazards in Engineering Research
Infrastructure (NHERI) facility.
<p>
The computations are performed in a workflow application. That is, the numerical
 simulations are actually performed by a sequence of different applications. The
  WE-UQ backend software runs these various applications for the user, taking the
  outputs from some programs and providing them as inputs to others. The design
  of the WE-UQ App is such that researchers are able to modify the backend
  application to utilize their own application in the workflow computations.
  This will ensure researchers are not limited to using the default applications
   we provide and will be enthused to provide their own applications for others
   to use.
<p>
Researchers are encouraged to comment on what additional features and applications they would
 like to see in the WE-UQ App. If you want a feature, chances are many of your
 colleagues would also benefit from it. Additional requests should be posted at the <a href="https://simcenter-messageboard.designsafe-ci.org/smf/index.php?board=5.0"> SimCenter forum </a>.
