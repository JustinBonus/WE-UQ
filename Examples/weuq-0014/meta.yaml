summary: "This example demonstrates the application of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based wind load generator for a building with complex geometry. The building used for this example is a landmark tall building. The workflow uses a transient CFD-solver for simulation wind loads and evaluates the response the building with uncertainty in the structural properties"
